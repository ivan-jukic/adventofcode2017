# Advent of Code 2017
### [http://adventofcode.com/2017](http://adventofcode.com/2017)

In this repo I'll be putting my solutions to daily puzzles of 2017 adventofcode challenge.

Last year I've used Elm lang to solve the adventOfCode puzzles, and I will do the same this year.
I hope to see some improvement in the way how I use the language, and how well I understand it.

Little bit of mathematics behind this puzzle [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulam_spiral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulam_spiral).
The fact that the bottom right corners are powere of odd numbers can be used to solve the first part of the puzzle.
